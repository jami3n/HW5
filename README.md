The initial screen shows 8 pieces of a sushi roll on a plate. The chopsticks can click anywhere, and if it clicks on the right sushi roll, it will play a munching sound and the sushi will be eaten. If not, an unpleasant sound plays. After all of the sushi have been eaten in the correct order, a bell rings and the 8 sushi roll pieces reappear.
